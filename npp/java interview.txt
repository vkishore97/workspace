methods in object class
how to get fully qualified path (class and package of a class)
how to clone an object using the clone method from the Object class?
how to access protected methods in other class? --> subclass
why do we use hashcode and equals method?
comparable and compartor
deep cloning and shallow cloing
serialization
externalization
log4j
design patterns
abstract factory

how to create a signleton class?
how to create a muttable class?
how to create an immutable class?
marker interface
serializable
multithreading
eg of singleton class
diamond problem
impact of java8 allowing static method and default  method in iterfaces in java8
reason behind allowing static method and default  method in iterfaces
diff bn abstract calss and interface
why do we instance block if already have constructor?
why string is immutable? 5M question + String constant pool

collection:
difference between collection(interface) and collections (class)
2M arraylist vs linkedlist
5M deep -> internal working of hashmap
hashtable vs hashmap
hashset vs hashmap
equal & hashcode method
treeset vs hashset

string buffer vs string builder

new features introduced in java8 :- stream, lambda, functional interface, optional class
optional class -> use, reason of introduction --> to avoid NPE

exception handling
exception vs error
checked exception vs unchecked exception with example
final finally finalize
throw vs throws

compiltime exception
runtime class -> 

try catch finally -> how to skip finally
try without catch -> try with resources
try without catch with finally
we can use multiple catch
sequence of multiple catch when catch blocks has relation parent-child -> answer is compilation error

multithreading
thread synchronization -> producer and consumer examples
thread lifecycle (wait and notify)
why interface implementatoin is better class extension while creating a multithreaded java app
deadlock
synchronous asynchronous
sleep vs wait
how to avoid deadlock -> mutual exclusion ......
